#include <Arduino.h>

/**
 * BareMinimum - The bare minimum of code needed to start an Arduino sketch.
 * 
 * The setup() function is called when a sketch starts.
 * 
 * Use it to initialize variables, pin modes, start using libraries, etc.
 * The setup function will only run once, after each powerup or reset of the
 * Arduino board.
 * 
 * After creating a setup() function, the loop() function does precisely what
 * its name suggests, and loops consecutively, allowing your program to change
 * and respond as it runs. Code in the loop() section of your sketch is used
 * to actively control the Arduino board.
 * 
 * The code below won't actually do anything, but it's structure is useful for
 * copying and pasting to get you started on any sketch of your own. It also
 * shows you how to make comments in your code.
 * 
 * Any line that starts with two slashes (//) will not be read by the
 * compiler, so you can write anything you want after it. Commenting your
 * code like this can be particularly helpful in explaining, both to yourself
 * and others, how your program functions step by step.
 *
 * This example code is in the public domain.
